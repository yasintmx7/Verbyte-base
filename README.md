  <p align="center">A decentralized, session-based word puzzle game on Base.</p>
</div>

## 🎮 The Protocol

**Verbyte** simulates a high-stakes terminal intrusion where players must decipher a hidden password (word) before their system integrity reaches zero.

Unlike traditional blockchain games that require a transaction for every move, Verbyte uses a **"Play Local, Verify Global"** architecture:

1.  **Session Mode**: Gameplay happens instantly in your browser (Off-Chain). No lag, no gas fees per guess.
2.  **Proof of Victory**: Only when you succeed do you sign a transaction to commit your win to the Base blockchain.
3.  **Multiplayer Sync**: Share a Room Seed with a friend to play the same puzzle, then sync your results on-chain to see who did better.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Gasless Gameplay**: Experience 60fps interactive puzzles without wallet popups interrupting your flow.
-   **On-Chain Reputation**: Your victories are permanent records on the Base network.
-   **Friendly Multiplayer**: 'Race Mode' via shared URL (Seeded Challenges).
-   **Dynamic Difficulty**: Words from 20+ categories including Tech, Space, and Crypto.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React, Vite, TailwindCSS
-   **Blockchain**: Ethers.js, Base Mainnet/Sepolia
-   **Design**: Lucide Icons, Retro-Terminal UI
